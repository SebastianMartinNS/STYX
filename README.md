## üìñ Overview

**Styx** is an advanced Command & Control (C2) framework designed for red team operations, penetration testing, and security research. It implements modern cryptographic protocols, stealth techniques, and anti-analysis measures to demonstrate real-world attack vectors while maintaining educational value.

    Note over Client,Server: Phase 1 - Key Exchange
    Client->>Server: POST /key_exchange (RSA-OAEP encrypted session key)
    Server->>Client: AES-GCM encrypted "KEY_EXCHANGE_OK"

### Component Structure

#### C++ Client (`lab_client_redt_advanced.cpp`)
- **Cryptography**: RSA-OAEP, AES-256-GCM via Windows CNG
- **Stealth**: Anti-debug, anti-VM, string obfuscation
- **Persistence**: Service installation, registry modifications
- **Collection**: Keylogging, screenshot capture, system reconnaissance
- **Communication**: WinHTTP with certificate pinning

#### Python Server (`c2_server_advanced.py`)
- **Cryptography**: RSA key generation, AES-GCM via cryptography.io
- **Session Management**: Thread-safe client state tracking
- **Command Queueing**: Prioritized command execution
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails and operational logging
- **Management**: Interactive operator interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

**Server Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- OpenSSL for certificate generation
- Required Python packages: `cryptography`, `pyOpenSSL`

**Client Requirements:**
- Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ build tools
- Windows SDK 10.0+
- Windows 7+ target system

### Quick Start

1. **Generate SSL Certificates:**
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate RSA Keypair:**
   ```bash
   python c2_server_advanced.py --generate-keys
   ```

4. **Compile Client:**
   ```bash
   cl.exe lab_client_redt_advanced.cpp /EHsc /MT /link advapi32.lib ws2_32.lib winhttp.lib crypt32.lib
   ```

5. **Start Server:**
   ```bash
   python c2_server_advanced.py
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Server Management Interface

The server provides an interactive management console:

```
=== C2 SERVER MANAGEMENT ===
1. List active clients
2. Send command to client
3. View server logs
4. Exit
```

### Client Deployment

Deploy the compiled client executable in your test environment. The client will:
1. Perform initial RSA key exchange
2. Establish encrypted session
3. Begin periodic beaconing
4. Execute queued commands
5. Return command output securely

### Example Commands

```bash
# System reconnaissance
exec whoami /all
exec systeminfo

# File operations
exec dir C:\\Users\\
exec type C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts

# Network reconnaissance
exec ipconfig /all
exec netstat -ano

# Process operations
exec tasklist
exec wmic process list brief
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Operational Security
- **Network Isolation**: Deploy only in isolated lab environments
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict server access to authorized IPs only
- **Key Protection**: Secure `server_private_key.pem` with strict permissions
- **Log Monitoring**: Regularly review server logs for anomalies

### Cryptographic Security
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly regenerate RSA keypairs
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Session keys are ephemeral
- **Authentication**: AES-GCM provides encryption and integrity
- **Certificate Validation**: Client validates server certificate

### Detection Evasion
- **Timing Variations**: Randomize beacon intervals to avoid pattern detection
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Encrypted payloads resist deep packet inspection
- **Process Behavior**: Mimic legitimate system processes
